# Hotel-Reservation
The major aim of the project is to perform data cleaning, preprocessing, transformation, feature selection and model exploration on the hotel reservation dataset.
The following procedures were carried out during this project:
•	Carried out data cleaning on the Hotel Reservation dataset.
•	Carried out data balancing on the dataset before building the model using SMOTE ( Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).
•	Two algorithm (Logistic Regresssion and KNeighbor) was use for this particular project.
•	Implemented a model to predict the cancellation of the hotel with an accuracy of 82%.
•	Skills & Tools Used: python, pandas, Seaborn,Machine Learning, data cleaning, visualization, and preprocessing
